          <p> A solution is one when there arises a problem. Notifynow is seen as a solution to the challenges faced in
            the process of death record management. The process to access death data is not easy for an organization as
            its confidential, also sensitive at the same time. Moreover, being government records they are obliged to
            security concerns. Where with a SOC2 compliant providing certification certifying authority that simplifies
            the issue here. Our platform is SOC2 compliant. </p>

          <p> The next challenge in working with Notifynow was understanding varied users in the categories. Jotting
            down the requirements individually in different use cases helped us come up with solutions. The features and
            functionality inbuilt came together from a cumulative source of research conducted on different users. That
            can also be stated as the result of 3 different methods for notifiers and creditors aiding convenience with
            better benefits. </p>

          satisfying and impressed our client and so did Philip & Cohen Associates. </p>
        <p> That brought us the offer to work with PCA to work on Notifynow. The moment just happened then. We
          collaborated with Phillips & Cohen for Notifynow, and now in progress, we are signing up for 5 more projects
          with PCA along with plans to launch for other multiple companies. </p>
        <p> Notifynow is one of the first sets of projects that we worked on from scratch. Now its capabilities are

          <p class="mb-0"> Notifynow is a web application with SOC2-compliant solution that manages death records
            through highly advanced protocols embedded with extended security features. It is currently functional in 4
            countries; the USA, the UK, Canada and Australia. While Phillips & Cohen Associates are curiously onboarding
            banks, financial institutions, Utility providers, etc., from multiple countries. This ensures that Notifnow
            is getting much better, also bigger, and we will be a part of its deployment. </p>
