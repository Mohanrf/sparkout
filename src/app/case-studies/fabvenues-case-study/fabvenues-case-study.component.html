            </h4>
            <p>
                The property owners, managers, and hosts list their property with all the details that they would like their travellers to know about it. Travellers get to see Property photos, property details, offerings like flowers & decor, snacks, food, and drinks (options), Room types, and tariffs that they can choose from and information like payment terms, cancellation policy, check-in and check-out times, and other relevant details (All this information comes from the property listing by the host).

            <p>
                Travellers can connect directly with the host for inquiries about a property, price, booking dates, etc. using the 'Chat with Host' option. The Traveller can book the place directly by choosing dates (if the option chosen by the host is 'Instant Booking'), or the Traveller can request to book. The host can release an invoice for the stay and/or offerings to the traveller for making payment to book the place.

                Once the first part (in the case of a 2/3 part payment) is paid, the booking is confirmed, and the calendar automatically gets blocked for that date. The payment made by the traveller is held in a virtual account, and it gets transferred to the host account (the bank account that's updated on Fabvenues profile) (as per the policy that can be checked at the time of listing).
