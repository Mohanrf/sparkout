                  <p>The healthcare sector has long been an early adopter of technological advancement. Machine learning, a subset of artificial intelligence, presently plays an important role in many health innovations, such as the development of new medical procedures, the handling of patient data, and the treatment of chronic diseases.</p>
                  <p>Machine learning is used in a wide range of health-care applications. According to a Mercury News report, machine learning and AI are expected to play a critical role in central nervous system clinical trials in the future.</p>
                  <p>Other prominent <a [routerLink]="['/artificial-intelligence-application-development-company']">machine learning developments</a> in healthcare, such as telemedicine and a few machine learning companies, are analysing how to organise and deliver patient information to doctors during telemedicine sessions,as well as gather information during virtual visits to streamline workflows</p>
                  <p>Machine learning is also used by pharmaceutical companies to help in drug discovery and development. For example, machine learning could one day help drugmakers to predict how patients will react to various drugs and identify which patients are most likely to benefit from the drug. Meanwhile, the Food and Drug Administration in the United States has passed a few policies that allow medical devices to use AI and machine learning technologies.The following discussion helps you get a detailed Insights of Machine Learning in Healthcare.</p>

                  <p>Given all of these applications, we constructed a list of 10 healthcare companies that use machine learning.</p>

                  <p>Pfizer uses machine learning and natural language processing with IBM's Watson AI technology for immuno-oncology research into how the body's immune system can fight cancer. This collaboration allows Pfizer to analyse large amounts of patient data and gain faster insights into how to develop more effective immuno-oncological treatments for patients.

                  <p>Insitro combines machine learning and computational biology to improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of drug development. Following the development of predictive models from massive biological data sets, the company employs machine learning to sift through this data and uncover important trends, such as new disease subtypes. Insitro's medical professionals can then adjust drugs and medicines to better protect patients from evolving diseases.

                  <h3>Summing up</h3>
                  <p>In the years to come, machine learning's effect on healthcare will undoubtedly grow. Therefore, clinicians and healthcare professionals need to start using machine learning to their benefit. The highest score for machine learning in healthcare goes to its powerful abilities in sorting and categorising health data, as well as speeding up doctors' clinical decisions and any types of visions that can save lives or make surgery less complicated.
