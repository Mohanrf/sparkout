          <p>So, let's take a look at how blockchain is transforming the supply chain ecosystem.</p>

<h3>Blockchain in Supply Chain</h3>
<p>A blockchain in the supply chain is an innovative solution to a wide range of issues. Various processes are involved in a typical supply chain, such as raw material procurement, manufacturing, financing, and so on. These processes may occur in one or more transactions. </p>
<p>These one or more transactions are recorded on different blocks in a blockchain supply chain. These records are then distributed over the blockchain's network of computer systems, making the data extremely accessible and transparent. Every stakeholder in the supply chain is an active participant in every transaction since every transaction is recorded on the blockchain and reflected in real time. </p>

<h4>Why do we require blockchain in the supply chain?</h4>
<p>One way that this technology can significantly enhance supply chains is by enabling faster and more cost-effective product delivery. The workings of blockchain technology can also be utilized to improve product traceability, co-ordination among the partners involved, and access to financing.</p>
<p>Using this powerful technology, parties collaborating on a single shared platform can significantly reduce delays and costs while eliminating the possibility of human error, which is frequently associated with transactions. This reduction in supply chain mediators also decreases the dangers of fraudulent activities. In case of fraud, the extensive records made available by the use of blockchain technology can help organizations locate the source.</p>
