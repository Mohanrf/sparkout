            Python is steadily gaining popularity and is now the world's second
            most popular programming language, with 11.3 million software
            developers worldwide using it. Aside from computer science, the
            Python language has proven to be useful in a wide range of other
            fields, including statistics, data analysis, physics, economics, and
            electronics. The sociology department even offers an introductory
            programming course for students.
          </p>
          <p>
            Python is one of the most popular and powerful programming
            languages, with simple syntax, dynamic semantics, and hundreds of
            robust libraries and frameworks. It is widely used for
            <a [routerLink]="['/web-application-development']">web development</a>, as well
            as big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Pythonâ€™s
            frameworks and features distinguish it from other web development
            languages. Let's take a look at the key Python frameworks for web
            development that every software engineer should think about before
            creating websites.
          </p>

          <h3>What are the Python frameworks for web development?</h3>
          <p>
            Python is an excellent programming language for both newcomers and
            experienced developers to learn because it emphasises code
            readability and includes numerous frameworks that aim to cushion the
            entire software development project. Python frameworks use the
            programming language to automate common application development and
            implementation processes.
          </p>
          <p>
            To be more specific, Python frameworks provide the foundation upon
            which to build the programme, which contributes substantially to
            time efficiency because engineers don't have to start developing
            from scratch and can focus on the application logic without dealing
            with low-level details and frequent functions.
          </p>
          <h3>Advantages of the Python Framework</h3>
          <p>
            The following are the primary advantages of Python web frameworks
            that demonstrate their importance for
            <a [routerLink]="['/web-application-development']">web development</a>:
          </p>

          <h4>Top-notch security</h4>
          <p>
            Frameworks are built by experienced software engineers to ensure
            safety and thus provide effective protection against a variety of
            attacks and threats, as well as provide developers with tools to
            avoid mistakes that cause security issues.
          </p>
          <h4>Time and money spent on development is reduced</h4>
          <p>
            With frameworks, you get the fundamental structure, which allows you
            to avoid reworking the wheel, saving time and money in the creation
            and deployment of an application, thus improving overall efficiency
            and reducing time and money spent on development.
          </p>
          <h4>Flexibility</h4>
          <p>
            Frameworks are used to develop micro functions as well as to support
            front-end and back-end development for larger projects due to their
            high flexibility.
          </p>
          <h3>Types of Python Frameworks for Web Development</h3>
          <p>Python frameworks are typically classified into three types:</p>
          <ul class="list-img">
            <li>Full-stack frameworks</li>
            <li>Micro-frameworks</li>
            <li>Asynchronous frameworks</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Let's look at their benefits.</h4>

                <h3>Full-stack frameworks</h3>
                <p>
                  The full-stack type is a framework that provides technical
                  solutions for two basic parts of development: the front-end
                  (also known as client-side) and the back-end (the
                  server-side). This framework sector is used for any type of
                  application.

                <p>
                  A micro-framework, as opposed to a full-stack framework, is a
                  lightweight type that refers to a minimalistic web application
                  that lacks most of the functionality found in a full-fledged
                  web application framework, such as authorization,
                  authentication, and data abstraction layer.

                  asynchronous frameworks.

            The use of Python in web development has increased. It is because
            Python is an open-source language that anybody can use and change
            for free. Tons of programmers are making Python web frameworks to
            help with application development. The best Python framework for web
            development will depend on a variety of elements, including the kind
            of application, time to market, and technical expertise.
