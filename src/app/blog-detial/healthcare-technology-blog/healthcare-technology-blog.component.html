            People are living longer lives and working longer hours. They can
            live healthy, independent lives well into old age due to advances in
            healthcare. It is the responsibility of healthcare providers to
            actively monitor the wellness of people, including those living in
            home health communities. For example, doctors must ensure that
            patients understand and follow prescription medication, exercise,
            diet, and other wellness factors.
          </p>
          <p>
            As medical technology makes admirable advances, we also see the rise
            of technology to manage healthcare in the digital age. We see
            healthcare technology trends in the industry that are not only
            intended to make patients' lives easier but also to solve some major
            issues in the health tech industry.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here are the seven most important problems confronting the
            healthcare industry around the world and an attempt to offer
            workable solutions to these problems.

          <h3>How to Solve Healthcare Problems with Digital Technology ?</h3>
          <p>
            The healthcare industry deals with a number of problems every day.
            On the other hand, technology can assist you in staying ahead of the
            curve and help you stand out as one of the most technologically
            advanced healthcare providers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here are some of the seven primary healthcare problems that
            technology can help solve for a better and healthier world.
          </p>
          <h4>Problem 1: No remote access</h4>

          <p>
            For decades, in-person consultations have been associated with
            healthcare. This has been a problem that has compelled patients to
            rush to the nearest healthcare facility for treatment. The COVID
            outbreak and lockdowns made matters worse. The virus's contagious
            effect kept people confined within the four walls of their homes. So
            what do they do if they need to see a doctor urgently?
          </p>
          <p>
            The need for remote access or virtual consultations is an urgent
            requirement that must be met in order to stay one step ahead of the
            technology adoption race.
          </p>
          <h4>
            Solution 1: Invest in mobile and web applications for healthcare
          </h4>
          <p>
            The flexibility and performance abilities of these remote-oriented
            platforms are being grown by mobile app developers. This creates a
            trustworthy environment for medical experts to provide quality care
            and advice to patients from miles away. Telemedicine aims to improve
            the quality of healthcare by using wearables and smartphones to
            track health. The use of
            <a [routerLink]="['/healthcare-application-development']"
              >technology in healthcare</a
            >
            has accelerated the development of products that use technology such
            as holography, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and
            augmented and virtual reality.
          </p>

          <hr class="my-5" />
          <h4>Problem 2 : Existing Healthcare Siloes</h4>

          <p>
            The world's healthcare professionals are disconnected and appear to
            be working in silos. There is a missing platform that can bring the
            healthcare industry together to discuss their learning, share
            knowledge, and take notes. Things could improve if there was a
            single platform dedicated solely to the healthcare industry.
            Everyone can learn from everyone else, which leads to improved
            understanding, diagnosis, and treatment.
          </p>
          <h4>
            Solution 2: A Social Networking App for Healthcare Professionals
          </h4>

          <p>
            The problem can be solved by building a social networking app
            specifically for healthcare professionals. Something along the lines
            of what Net Solutions accomplished with "The OCR" (The On Call
            Room)—a mobile social platform for healthcare professionals.
          </p>
          <ul class="list-img">
            <li>
              The healthcare industry has seen the most advancement and
              innovation.
            </li>
            <li>
              Ability to share photos, PDFs, PowerPoint presentations, Excel
              spreadsheets, and videos
            </li>
            <li>Healthcare professionals' ability to share patient data</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The solution is viable and contributes to a healthier and better
            world by enabling collaboration and communication in the sector.
            Sharing knowledge can assist in the resolution of health issues
            while also promoting inclusivity.
          </p>

          <hr class="my-5" />

          <h4>Problem 3: Medicare and Medicaid Reimbursement Issues</h4>

          <p>
            Medicare and Medicaid are government healthcare programs that
            provide patients with healthcare coverage. Their repayment
            structures differ significantly and require a well-coordinated
            management process.
          </p>
          <p>
            The procedures for filing and receiving Medicare and Medicaid are
            very different and add another task to healthcare professionals'
            to-do lists. The regulations also require them to maintain and
            record patient records in a specific format for the services
            provided.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whenever a Medicare patient receives treatment, doctors must fill
            out the prescribed electronic forms as proof that the patient
            received the healthcare service. The rules and regulations have made
            it mandatory for healthcare professionals to follow the process in
            order to be paid, significantly increasing the workload.
          </p>

          <h4>Solution 3: Invest in the Medicaid EHR systems and Medicare</h4>

            </picture>
          </div>

          <p>
            One of the most contentious political issues right now is healthcare
            reform. Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems are one of the
            healthcare technology trends that the industry is eager to adopt in
            order to simplify health record-keeping as well as Medicare and
            Medicaid filing.
          </p>
          <p>
            EHRs provide an apolitical tool for controlling health-care
            spending, which is expected to grow at a 5.8% annual rate until
            2022. EHR systems facilitate the use of appropriate electronic forms
            for government Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement. It is simple for
            healthcare professionals to keep patients' health records and fill
            out reimbursement forms after the service has been rendered.
          </p>

          <h4>Problem 4: Lack of Supply Management System</h4>
          <div class="details-img-wrap">
            <picture>
              <source
                srcset="

            />
            </picture>
          </div>
          <p>
            Traditional supply chain management is inefficient and wasteful on a
            regular basis. It results in money wasted on lost and damaged
            inventory, improper delivery of equipment or medication, and patient
            harm, all of which add up to massive financial losses for healthcare
            services. Supply shortages, misplaced inventory, and
            less-than-stellar shrinkage prevention measures all contribute to
            the fact that hospitals are epicenters for wasteful operations in
            the absence of a proper supply management system.
          </p>

          <h4>Solution 4: Take advantage of a data management system</h4>
          <p>
            To avoid heavy losses and unnecessary spending, it is critical to
            turn to digital
            <a [routerLink]="['/healthcare-application-development']"
              >healthcare technology providers</a
            >
            for a powerful and effective solution. If you want to be at the top
            of supply chain management, invest in an inventory management system
            or a warehouse management system.
          </p>
          <p>
            A strong data management system powered by data analytics not only
            is constantly updated and operates within an easy-to-use graphic
            user interface (GUI), but it also provides insightful and meaningful
            data. Administrative and medical professionals alike will benefit
            from having immediate access to accurate inventory numbers and
            current budget allocations.
          </p>

          <hr class="my-5" />
          <h4>Problem 5: Managing Massive Volumes of Patient Data</h4>
          <p>
            One of the most bewildering aspects of healthcare is patient-related
            data. The existing data pool grows with each new addition to the
            patient database. As a result, managing this data becomes even more
            difficult. It is only unrealistic to expect traditional
            infrastructure to manage and secure data.
          </p>
          <p>
            The storage and retrieval of this patient data when it is required
            is a challenge that hospitals must address. Data overload and
            mismanagement frequently result in incorrect diagnoses, compromised
            data security, ineffective treatment, lapsed appointments, failure
            to keep up with changes in the progress or regression of the
            patient's condition, and so on. The consequences can be disastrous
            for both doctors and patients.
          </p>
          <h4>Solution 5: Cloud + Data Analytics Capabilities</h4>
          <p>
            The healthcare technology solutions to this problem are cloud-based
            data systems and mobile portals. These solutions provide healthcare
            professionals with real-time access to patient data such as
            registrations, medical histories, diagnoses, treatments, and
            appointments, among other things. Since the storage and retrieval
            are cloud-based, the records are updated in real-time and properly
            secured. Cloud-based solutions that aid in the maintenance of a
            patient database are also useful, as are data analytics
            capabilities.
          </p>

          <hr class="my-5" />
          <h4>Problem 6: Data Sharing Inefficiencies and Errors</h4>
          <p>
            Despite significant advances in medical science, inefficiencies and
            healthcare errors persist due to the healthcare industry's
            traditional management technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            One particular source of concern is the transfer of patient data
            from one department or hospital to another. Traditional patient
            record sharing is time-consuming and inefficient, and it exposes
            patient information to a breach. In patients requiring urgent or
            complicated treatment, an incomplete or inefficient exchange of this
            data can be dangerous.
          </p>

          <h4>Solution 6: Blockchain-Based Database</h4>

            To provide a comprehensive and satisfying patient experience, all
            parties involved in healthcare—doctors, scheme providers, insurance
            providers, doctors, and patients—must be able to securely exchange
            information with one another. Using cloud-based data management
            systems can be a reliable solution to the inefficiencies caused by
            traditional pen-and-paper data management methods. The most
            promising solution to this healthcare management problem is to store
            and share patient records in a blockchain-based database. This
            healthcare technology trend can eliminate insecurity while
            preserving patient privacy and information integrity.

          <h4>Problem 7: A lack of online pharmacies</h4>
          <p>
            People's shopping habits have changed as the number of eCommerce
            stores on the internet has increased. They want everything to be
            available online. However, the lack of online medical stores causes
            the industry to lag behind other industries. Because medicines sold
            online must be prescription-based, there is a lack of e-stores that
            can disrupt the market and provide consumers with convenience.
          </p>

          <h4>
            Solution 7: Establishing Prescription-Only Online Medical Stores
          </h4>
          <p>
            You should consider opening an online pharmaceutical store. The
            online market has enormous potential. However, you may not be able
            to disrupt the market because Amazon (a company stereotyped for
            disruptions) recently launched Amazon Pharmacy, which provides home
            delivery for prescription-based medicines.
          </p>

          <hr class="my-5" />
          <h4>The future of healthcare technology</h4>
          <p>
            There's no denying that the healthcare industry has come a long way,
            as technology continues to play an important role in it. Healthcare
            technology continues to advance in the right direction, from dealing
            with data overload across multiple institutions to connecting
            doctors and patients from opposite ends of the globe via mobile
            apps.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may be seeing only the tip of the iceberg in terms of what mobile
            apps, cloud-based services, and other digital assets can offer
