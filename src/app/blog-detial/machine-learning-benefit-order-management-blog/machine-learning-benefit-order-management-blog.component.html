          <h3>What is Order Management?</h3>

          <p>
            Order management uses a set of processes that are a part of the
            supply chain. It usually consists of receiving orders, Tracking them
            and delivering them to the customers. Later receiving feedback and
            working on its improvements are also accounted for here. The order
            management process starts with the customer placing the order and
            ends when it is delivered. Usually interacts based on the
            requirements of the customer and fulfilling them.

              simplicity breaks the requirements.
            </li>
            <li>
              Sometimes ML models turn out to be biased giving inaccurate
              predictions. And here it's important to test the model for its
              favoritism and make changes accordingly.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Meanwhile, these issues can be sorted in the following ways.</h4>

            management is a common thing today, from grocery to granite,
            anything everywhere, it's ordered and placed in a matter of clicks.
            Sounding simple and easy, it undergoes various “If”, ‘and’ and ‘or’
            cases. Incorporating Machine learning into an order management
            system is a perfect way to scrape efficiency in your business space.
