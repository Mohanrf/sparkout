            The thumping is high, and it's a big yesss!!!!!!!!!! The top secret
            of Silicon Valley is unveiled to the world. The Apple Vision Pro is
            officially launched in the market, and what better Apple iStores
            could get us? But we all know there is more to avail. Adopting the
            mixed reality concept and Spatial computing techniques the Vision
            Pro is designed to collide digital content with the physical world
            in a wink. “Immersive” is what that screams all over yet, its
            capabilities and abilities are high. How? Let’s diverge.
          </p>
          <h3>Apple Vision Pro - What Is It And What They Do?</h3>

          <p>
            Apple Vision Pro is A unique and revolutionary Spatial computer
            device that easily blends digital content with the physical world.
            Prevailing the concept of Mixed reality, it allows users to stay in
            the present and connect with the world and their needs through VR
            screens.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Apple Vision Pro Headset provides users an endless space for
            applications and upscales beyond the traditional displays. With a
            fully three-dimensional user interface that is controlled through
            natural and intuitive input possibilities - the user’s eyes, hands,
            and voice take control.
          </p>
          <p>
            It introduced a new operating system, VisionOS, to the world. This
            is the very first Spatial operating system that allows real users to
            interact with the digital world contents. The unique feature of the
            Apple Vision Pro is its ultrahigh-resolution display system with 23
            million pixels across two displays. The production house has used
            proper Apple silicon in a dual-chip design ensuring the users get
            the experience as they get in the real eyes.
          </p>

          <h3>Tech Specs Inherited In Apple Vision Pro</h3>
          <p>
            A virtual reality headset that is uniquely crafted to provide an
            immersive and realistic experience. The Apple vision pro imbibes
            high technological features in it and they are listed below.
          </p>
          <ul class="list-img">
            <li>
              <b>The Ultra High-resolution Display System</b><br />
              The headset has two display features each with 3600X1920 a total
              of 23 million pixels which is four times the resolution of the
              previous generation VR headsets. It's sharper and brings out
              minute details in the image. It has a high refresh rate of 120Hz
              which reduces motion sickness and provides a smooth experience.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Advanced Spatial Audio System </b><br />
              Being a combination of a built-in camera and microphone, it's
              convenient to track the user's motions, and movements. And using
              the information of eye movements, heads, and hands, a 360-degree
              soundscape is created around the user giving the feel that the
              user is actually in a VR environment, and significantly improved
              immersion factors are reflected.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Inbuild Chips</b><br />
              The Vision Pro, which is powered by Apple’s M2 chip, is very
              powerful and delivers high-quality graphic experiences and
              performances. It is a custom-designed system-on-a-chip based on
              the 2nd generation Silicon architecture of Apple. It has an 8-core
              CPU, 10-core GPU, and 16-core neural engine. The M2 chip can run
              on macOS ventures and other latest OS of Mac.<br />
              The other is the R1 chip which is also custom-designed,
              specifically designed for the Vision Pro headset. Sensor data are
              handled here, accumulating data from the 12 cameras, 5 sensors,
              and 6 microphones. It also does the duty of streaming video and
              audio content in the headset.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Camera Specifications</b><br />
              The apple vision pro headset has 12 cameras that work in
              correspondence to provide users with spatial awareness. The
              cameras work together to create a lifelike experience by creating
              detailed models of the user’s environment. With the head and hand
              movements of the users, the devices collide with the objects in
              the real world with that in the digital space.
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>Sensors Specifications</b><br />
              LiDAR scanners provide in-depth sensing, rendering very close
              experiences of reality. They create a 3D map of the user’s
              environment that is used to improve the accuracy of the landscapes
              and provide spatial awareness features.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Audio systems</b><br />
              The Vision Pro has six audio microphones for giving the users a
              full-on spatial audio experience. This enables the user to hear
              from different directions
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>

            </li>
            <li>
              Hand tracking technology tracks hand actions and is used to
              interact with the objects in the VR environment.
            </li>
            <li>
              Pass-through mode enables the users to see the real world through
              the headset making it easy to navigate, interact and immerse in
              the physical objects

            </li>
            <li>
              The Vision Pro has no controller and it completely acts on users'
              hands, eyes, and head sensory censors. Hand action can control the
              movement of slides and sites.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Eyesight of vision pro enables the user to connect with the
              real world. The display gets transparent when another person
              approaches and they both could interact. And it also gives cues to
              others about users' focus.
            </li>
            <li>
              The VisonOS gave life to the Apple Vision Pro. The OS is curated
