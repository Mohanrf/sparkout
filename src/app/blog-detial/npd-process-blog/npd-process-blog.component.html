          <p>Are you thinking of entering the market with a new product? Then, do
          thorough research on what you need. Don't know where to dig? We are
          here with this blog post to guide you.</p>

          <p>Developing a new product is a big deal. The more passionate we are about developing a product, the
          more attention we need. Everything in the field of business should be
          well researched and planned. This is true especially when launching a
          new product.</p>

          <p>To remain successful in the face of maturing products,
          companies need a continuous stream of fresh ideas that are
          successfully developed into new products. The way to achieve new
          products is through a structured and carefully-executed New Product
          Development (NPD) process.</p>

          <p>Without further ado, let's get a jump to the point!</p>

          <h3>What is New Product Development Process (NPD)?</h3>

          <p>
            Before diving into the big words of the New Product Development
            Process, you need a picture of what New Product Development is.
          </p>

          <p>
            As the name implies, NPD is how to release a new product in the
            market proactively. The new product is of two kinds, one is a
            completely new product to the industry and the other one is a
            variation of an existing one. Whichever of these two you choose, you
            need to look at it in its own way.
          </p>

          <p>
            If it is a completely new product, there are many things like its
            demand in the market, how many people will benefit from it, what
            profit can be made and how it can be successful. However, the first
            thing to do when developing a new version of a product is to know
            the pros and cons of the old product and what changes will benefit
            the new product to be successful.
          </p>

          <p>
            The complete set of activities through which a firm visualizes and
            delivers a new offering is called the new product development
            process. It includes all necessary steps from determining
            product-market fit to determining the optimal approach to produce
            and launch the product to determining its pricing and go-to-market
            strategy.
          </p>

          <p>
            As you can imagine, the NPD process looks a little different from an
            engineering angle of view. Here, the technical aspects are
            emphasized more, while the business implications are in the
            background. It means that new product development focuses more on
            technical design, integration of features, prototyping, etc. A
            structured and carefully executed new product development process
            (NPD) is the best way to achieve success with new products.
          </p>

          <h3>7 building blocks of the NPD process</h3>
          <p>
            Several levels can be looked at in the NPD. Here we break down the
            process of creating a new product into seven.
          </p>

          <p>
            Mainly speaking, this seven-step process is about how to launch your
            new product and how to make it run in the front line of the market.
          </p>

          <p>
            This is usually accomplished by encouraging design and product
            improvement through innovative ideas and professional technical
            approaches. Such as:
          </p>

          <ul class="list-img">
            <li>Use Concept Generation to analyze user needs.</li>
            <li>Deep dive into the problems and pick the best solution.</li>
            <li>Addresses usability, security, and user acceptance issues to
              further improve existing products.</li>
            <li>Use principles of Aesthetics and Ergonomics.</li>
            <li>Compare your ideas and rank your concepts.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Let’s have a look at the different stages of new product
            development.
          </p>

          <h4>1. Idea Generation</h4>

           <p>
                    The beginning of developing any product is when you start thinking
                    about it. It is one of the most crucial phases of NPD and entails
                    brainstorming an idea that would help you overcome existing
                    drawbacks in a novel and creative way. It’s important to have a deep
                    study of the target audience and their pain points, which you should
                    tackle while brainstorming ideas to help you meet customer demands.
          </p>




          <p>
            The areas that you need to give more focus on while brainstorming
            your ideas about the new product development are:

        <h4>2. Idea Screening</h4>

          <p>
                  The second stage of the NPD process is idea screening. Sort out the
                  best ones. Idea screening refers to the ideas we get through idea
                  generation that are screened well to spot good ones and flush out
                  the poor ones as soon as possible.
                </p>
          <p>
            While in the stage of idea generation we collect a list of ideas,
            and it is impossible to work out all of those. The purpose of idea
            screening is to cut-shot the list of ideas. This is because the cost
            of product development increases tremendously at later stages.
            Companies can't take every idea to the next level.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's not so easy to say drop the poor ideas. Make sure that each
            idea is valuable or not because the quality of the product will be
            affected if we drop the better ideas. But if we choose ineffective
            ideas, it will affect the cost very badly.
          </p>

          <h4>3. Concept development & testing</h4>
          <p>
                    It is not enough for us to know what product we are going to have
                    and what ideas have made it through. Additionally, we need to
                    convince our prime target customers. Concept development means
                    analyzing it so that they can understand it in a better way.
                  </p>



          <p>
            Instead of testing the product itself, at this stage, you will be
            testing the concept of your product. A product concept is a more
            comprehensive version of a concept expressed in customer-friendly
            terms.
          </p>

          <ul class="list-img">
            <li>A product idea:- This is a set of ideas for a possible
              product.</li>
            <li>A product concept:- This is a detailed version of the concept
              stated in meaningful consumer terms.</li>
            <li>A product image:- This is how consumers perceive an actual or
              potential product.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Essential steps of concept development are:</p>

          <div class="common-method-wrap mb-3">
            <ul class="list-img">
              <li>Measuring the gain and pain ratio</li>
              <li>Perform a competitor analysis test</li>
              <li>Identify the core features of the product</li>
                <li>Create a value proposition chart</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <p>
            Once you've developed a well-designed concept, testing is the next
            logical step. Customers should be able to understand the concept and
            verify that it has been created effectively. Your next step is to
            pitch your idea to a limited group of potential customers and
            evaluate/test it.

                    The next exciting step in the NPD is the developing process of
                    business and marketing strategy. After developing a clear picture of
                    the product concept, next, we moved and planned how to introduce the

          <h4>5. Product development</h4>
          <p>
                    At this stage of the new product development process, your product
                    is best suited to be a prototype or the first version of the
                    product. This way, you get a physical representation of your idea
                    that you can test in real life, not just on paper. This prototype,
                    also known as Minimum Viable Product (MVP), is a simplified version
                    of your product to get a sense of how it works and areas for
                    improvement.
                  </p>



          <p>
            Sometimes it is necessary to develop one or more physical versions
            of the product concept is needed. Creating a successful prototype
            model takes days, months, or even years.
          </p>
          <p>
            In most cases marketers choose the consumers for doing the testing
            job, It gives us more realistic results. Their experience and view
            of the point are very useful in the product development step.
          </p>

          <hr class="my-5" />

          <h4>6. Test marketing</h4>
          <p>
            The final stage before commercialization is test marketing. In this
            stage, the product and its proposed marketing program are tested in
            realistic market settings. Therefore, test marketing gives the
            marketer the experience of marketing the product before going to the
            big expense of a full introduction.
          </p>


          <p>
            Testing your product early before investing too much time and money
            can ensure its success. A positive response indicates that there is
            sufficient demand for the product, leading to the start of the
            manufacturing process.

          <h4>7. Commercialization</h4>
          <p>
            The Final last stage of NPD is commercialization. In this phase, the
            management has the final decision to take, which means launch or not
            launch the product. Otherwise, we can state it as commercialization
            refers to introducing a newly developed product directly into the
            market.
          </p>

          <p>
            At this stage, the highest costs are incurred, and the company needs
            to build or rent a manufacturing facility. In the first year, a
            large amount of money may be spent on advertising, sales promotion,
            and other marketing efforts.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this stage, we mainly focus on the time and place. Where to
            launch the product is a crucial decision and you need to think
            twice. Similarly, when to launch the product is also that much
            important.
