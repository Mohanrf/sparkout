          <h3>What is Fintech?</h3>
          <p>
            The combination of financial services and technology is referred to
            as fintech. Fintech companies are those that use technology to
            deliver financial services and operate in the fintech area. Online
            banking, mobile payments, and investment advice are examples of such
            services.
          </p>
          <h4>Growth in Fintech</h4>
          <p>
            As previously said, Fintech is a rapidly expanding business. Indeed,
            the overall value of global investments in fintech startups surged
            considerably between 2010 and 2023, reaching 215.4 billion US
            dollars. According to KPMG, global fintech investment hit a new high
            of $98 billion in the first half of 2022.
          </p>
          <p>
            The increased usage of mobile devices and the internet has
            contributed to the rise of fintech business. Furthermore, there has
            been an increase in interest in the fintech business as a result of
            the growing demand for simple and easy-to-use financial goods and
            services.
          </p>
          <hr class="my-5" />

          <h3>Technological advantage</h3>
          <p>
            Fintech companies often excel at providing these services with
            greater speed and cost-effectiveness compared to conventional
            financial institutions. This is due to the fact that fintech
            companies frequently use technology to automate operations.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the realm of Fintech, a mobile app can be leveraged by companies
            to enable individuals to deposit checks and execute money transfers
            seamlessly. Fintech firms often cater to people who are underserved
            by conventional financial institutions, including those residing in
            developing countries without access to traditional banking services.
            By extending their offerings, fintech companies have the capacity to
            provide vital financial services to these populations, facilitating
            greater financial inclusion and empowerment.
          </p>
          <p>
            M-Kopa is one example of a fintech company that serves people in
            developing countries who have no access to regular banking systems.
            This company provides a low-cost way for customers to buy
            electricity, pay bills, and make mobile payments with their cell
            phones.

          <h3>How is Fintech shaping banking, then?</h3>
          <p>
            It would be incorrect to say that fintech is rapidly replacing
            traditional banks in the market. Fintech investment banking brings
            value to banks in the global financial market, changing the whole
            banking sector and boosting its competitiveness and innovation. The
            following are a few ways that fintech changing investment banking as
            we know it:
          </p>

          <h4>Digitalization</h4>
          <p>
            One significant way the financial technology sector is altering the
            banking system is by ditching the brick-and-mortar model and
            becoming entirely digital. Modern banking fintech solutions can
            offer a range of services in a single app, including money transfers
            between accounts, chatbots that offer financial advice, and loan
            calculators. Even without going to a bank branch, users can apply
            for a loan or credit card.
          </p>

          <h4>Smaller fee policies</h4>
          <p>
            Another way that fintech is changing investment banking is through
            transaction fees. Banks had to reconsider their business strategy,
            which is mainly based on charging clients high fees for domestic and
            international transfers. With the rise of fintech, customers now
            have the opportunity to make it cheaper, and they are already taking
            advantage of it.
          </p>

          <h4>Convenience and Better user experience</h4>
          <p>
            Due to the widespread use of artificial intelligence and machine
            learning, fintech solutions provide users with increased diversity
            and the opportunity to select the most appropriate product.
            Customers no longer require face-to-face counsel from a bank when
            selecting the type of mortgage, for example; all they need to do is
            go through a quick test in the app, which takes approximately 1 or 2
            minutes.
          </p>
          <p>
            For purposes of identification and verification, many banks still
            require customers to visit a branch. With fintech, face recognition
            software on a smartphone might be used to handle banking.
          </p>

          <h4>Blockchain technology</h4>
          <p>
            Blockchain technology is the most popular financial technology tool
            right now. Blockchain allows for the fast transfer of money and
            other financial assets. There are no fees, no third parties, and no
            minimum transaction valueâ€”only a quick funds transfer. Bitcoin can
            perform the same transfer in minutes, while other blockchain systems
            may perform similar transfers in seconds. Banks have begun to
            include this technology in their mobile banking apps in order to
            provide customers with the option to instantly transfer financial
            value at any time
          </p>

          <h4>Open banking</h4>
          <p>
            Open banking revolutionizes the financial services landscape by
            reducing barriers for providers and fostering innovation. Banks
            invest in fintech because this concept compels traditional financial
            institutions to share their financial data through APIs (Application
            Programming Interfaces), unlocking the immense potential for
            collaboration and the development of advanced financial technology
            products. While the extent of data sharing may vary by country, the
            proliferation of open APIs creates opportunities for personalized
            and contextually relevant financial products.

          <h3>
            Factors and Preconditions for the Development of Fintech in the
            Banking Industry
          </h3>
          <p>
            The following factors have contributed to the rapid growth of
            financial technologies in the past five years:
          </p>
          <p>
            1. Customer dissatisfaction with banking during the global financial
            crisis as well as harsher regulation. Trust is an essential
            component for the smooth functioning of the financial system, and
            its erosion has accelerated the inevitable progression of financial
            technology advancements. In light of this situation, there is a
            demand for the services offered by fintech startups, along with a
            necessity to enhance existing services due to reduced profitability
            resulting from increased regulations.
          </p>
          <p>
            2. The increase in mobile Internet has shifted the focus of the
            bank's customer acquisition strategy from adding another branch to
            developing online services, and banks investing in fintech are
            maintaining the mobile version of the site.
          </p>
          <p>
            3. The largest generation of millennials in world history is a
            powerful force behind change in the financial sector due to their
            desire for innovation and increased demands for service ease,
            quality, and speed.
          </p>
          <p>
            4. Consumer rights are usually prioritized in banking regulation,
            but their protection does not obstruct the adoption of innovations
            and flexibly adapts the rules to the needs of the financial sector.
            Contrarily, the financial industry is heavily controlled in other
            nations, which impedes the growth of the financial services sector.
          </p>
          <p>
            5. The tech company's success in other economic areas such as
            retail, entertainment, etc. Entrepreneurs, including those in the
            financial industry, have become interested in new business
            opportunities due to the rise of profitable organizations that have
            dramatically altered their markets and provided more competitive
            goods and services.
          </p>

          <hr class="my-5" />
          <h3>What does this imply for the future of banking?</h3>
          <p>
            The rise of fintech or financial technology, or, is simultaneously
            contributing to a skill gap within the industry. Autonomous Research
            reveals that machine learning and AI have the potential to replace
            over $1 trillion of the existing cost structure in financial
            services by 2030.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite the considerable opportunities for rewarding careers in
            banking and finance, with 75% of financial services organizations
            generating job opportunities related to new technologies, a
            significant challenge arises in filling these positions.
            Approximately 42% of these organizations are encountering
            difficulties finding suitable candidates to meet the demand for
            these roles.
          </p>

          <hr class="my-5" />
          <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
          <p>
            The investment banking industry is undergoing massive upheaval as a
            result of fintech, with new competitors entering the market and
            older organizations being compelled to adapt to new technology and
            business models. As fintech evolves and new technologies emerge, the
            industry is expected to face even more disruption in the coming
            years.
