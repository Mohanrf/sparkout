And industries are working to meet this, where manufacturing executives are managing to attract a new worker force which is their high-priority task along with retention and reskilling.
          </p>
          <p>Then we have to consider if manufacturers have done good work in promoting their sector. It’s a blunt ‘NO’, there is nothing fancy about working in this sector. Sometimes seen monotonous. Whereas this could actually change! Through automation leaping, manufacturers can change their minds about retirement and voluntary walkouts. And this can also contribute to job replacement by professionals who are data analysts, those in robotics, other tech streams of engineering, and more.
